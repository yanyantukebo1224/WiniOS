 * first exec touch decompresses it into a FRESH physical page, and TXM's
 * exec blessing does not survive the frame replacement. It also explains the
 * reuse correlation as a time confound: late copies land on freelist ranges
 * AND under peak pressure.

             * 868 MB of headroom and a 1 MB mach_vm_allocate SUCCEEDED, so the
             * libsystem_malloc BRK is NOT out-of-memory — the zone is genuinely
             * corrupt. wineserver's alloc_object is merely the next caller to
             * walk a damaged free list; it is the victim, not the culprit.
             *
             * Knowing WHO corrupts it starts with knowing WHEN. malloc_zone_check
             * walks and validates every zone, so the first cycle it fails brackets
             * the damage to a 2-second window that can be read straight off the
             * surrounding log. Note this whole app is ONE process: the zone is
             * shared by our Swift/ObjC code, wine, wineserver, FEX, DXMT and any
             * wild guest write, so the bracket is the only cheap way in.
             *
             * Self-calibrating: the first PASS is logged too, with its cost in ms.
             * Without that, silence would be ambiguous between "heap healthy" and
             * "probe never ran". If the cost turns out to be large we will see it

 * exports the allocator and the main module defers to it, and that linkage may
 * not survive our loader.
 *
 * The caller is guest x86-64 running under FEX, so a native stack scan finds
 * thunks and IAT slots, not the requester (that mistake cost a run earlier).
 * Read FEX's live guest RIP instead — TEB+0x1788 -> CPUArea+0x30 -> state,

/* ml151 LAZY POOL RESERVATION (Tier 2, first cut).
 *
 * MEASURED: at the moment PartitionAlloc needs all four 16GB pools reserved, it
 * has committed essentially NOTHING — [bigres-use] showed 0MB in two pools and
 * <1MB in the third across 24 calls. The reservation at Init() is pure
 * address-space bookkeeping, so a pool does not need to be backed to be
 * accepted; it only needs the aligned base PA asked for.
 *
 * That matters because the arithmetic is otherwise unwinnable: four pools want
 * 64GB of RANGE, the usable window is ~64GB, and furniture needs ~14GB of it.
 * Treating a reservation as if it consumed real space is what made this look
 * impossible.
 *
 * FIRST CUT, deliberately minimal: when every real placement for a jumbo
 * reserve fails, hand PA a 16GB-aligned slot that no pool has taken and record
 * the range as SOFT — no backing. Commits land in NtAllocateVirtualMemory,
 * which we own, so there is no fault handling: materialise the sub-range there.
 *
 * KNOWN RISK, accepted for now and instrumented rather than hidden: the only
 * free aligned slot (0x7000000000) spans the furniture window, so a later PA
 * commit can land where furniture already lives. We do NOT fence furniture out
 * of it — that window is the only place furniture can go. Instead every commit
 * into a soft range is checked against the kernel map first and a collision is
 * reported loudly. PA bumps upward from a pool base and committed ~0% at Init,
 * so the margin should be large; if [soft-pool] COLLISION appears, this design
 * needs the full own-and-broker-the-window treatment before it can be trusted. */

 * in our 64GB usable band the only 8GB-aligned stretch outside the PA pool
 * slots is [0x7200000000, 0x7400000000), and top-down furniture placement
 * fills its tail with DLL image copies long before CEF asks (~85s in). The

 * So reserve the stretch at boot, before any furniture can land in it, and

 * actually off. In rpcrt4 that means TRACE("*%p=(%p)...", CContext, *CContext)
 * dereferences the context handle: with a bad handle that is an instant fault,
 * which is exactly the 28x RtlLeaveCriticalSection / NDRCContextUnmarshall
 * cluster that stalls the webhelper's RPC handshake.
 *
 * Wine resolves these lazily per channel, so a module copied before a channel was
 * ever used keeps 0xff forever. Normalise them in the copy: ERR only (0x02),
 * matching WINEDEBUG=err+all. Costs nothing and removes TRACE argument
 * evaluation — and its pointer dereferences — from every copied DLL.

/* ml141 TASK #34 THE REAL FIX — remove the .text/.data page sharing.
 *
 * PE sections are 4KB-aligned but iOS hardware pages are 16KB, so a writable
 * section routinely begins part-way into a page whose earlier bytes are the
 * TAIL OF .text. The RW mprotect that makes .data writable then strips EXECUTE
 * from that page of live code, permanently (mprotect drops it from
 * max_protection on blessed memory). That is task #34: one dead page per
 * module, always 64KB-aligned, fatal only when execution finally reaches it —
 * which is why CEF dies in libarm64ecfex's JIT emitters and Thumper never does.
 *
 * ml141 first tried skipping the shared page (round the RW range UP). That did
 * remove every BORN NON-EXEC page, but a .data STXR into the now-read-only
 * shared page killed steam.exe after 61 unix calls — the SIGBUS store emulator
 * does not cover store-exclusive. Neither side can lose the page.
 *
 * So don't arbitrate: eliminate the overlap. Shift the copy's pool offset so
 * the first writable section lands exactly on a 16KB boundary. Everything below
 * it is RX either way, so .text being page-misaligned costs nothing, and no
 * page is ever both code and data. The shift is a deterministic function of the
 * image, so every copy of a DLL still gets an identical layout — the
 * precondition the .text-sharing/tramp-fold work depends on. */

 * asking whether a thread is still executing JIT code in it, and `tail REUSE`
 * hands the same range straight back out to the next requester, which then
 * compiles different code over it.
 *
 * ml556 caught exactly that: carve rx=0x1543f8000 size=0x1000000 was FREEd and
 * REUSEd eight times, and the fatal fault landed at host pc 0x154d4008c — INSIDE
 * that range — with garbage registers (base reg = 0x40 -> a NULL+0x40 atomic
 * load). A thread was running in code that had been recycled underneath it.
 *
 * That also explains why the fatal site MOVES between runs (frame clear /
 * PartitionAlloc refcount CHECK / NULL-this call): the victim depends on what
 * happened to be compiled into the recycled range.
 *
 * Frees are rare (33-53 per run), so a full thread scan here costs nothing
 * measurable. Refusing to free an occupied carve reinstates a BOUNDED leak —
 * which is what ml438 set out to fix — but a leak is strictly better than
 * executing recycled code, and the carve becomes freeable on the next release

 * 0x8000000000) free of Wine furniture so PartitionAlloc's third 16GB pool can
 * land there. The ml96/ml105 census is deterministic: pools 1-2 take the 480G
 * and 464G slots (pool 2's guard-before layout also poisons the top 64KB of the
 * 448G slot, so evicting our RW alias would NOT help pool 3), and pool 3's
 * offset-0 slot walk tries 0x7C00000000 FIRST — it fails only because Wine's
 * top-down placement packs images/TEBs/stacks into [0x7e874c0000, top). Total
 * furniture there is ~6GB, and [0x7038000000, 0x73ffff0000) = 15.1GB is free to
 * hold it. Applied ONLY to kernel-pick placements smaller than 1GB with no
 * caller-imposed limits — jumbo reserves and explicit/fixed requests are
 * untouched. NOTE: the [reclaim-recover] data-fault band in signal_arm64_ios.c
 * watches this same [496G,512G) range for FEX arena recovery; if arenas move
 * below the ceiling, that band goes quiet — watch Thumper-under-pressure for a
 * regression and move the band with them if needed.
 *
 * ml106 REVISED: the first ceiling (0x7C00000000, 1GB size gate) backfired two
 * ways. (1) Furniture packed top-down to JUST under the ceiling, so the last
 * 64KB below 0x7C00000000 was always occupied and the 480G slot's top was
 * poisoned. (2) A 4GB guard-style tenant that does NOT go through
 * NtAllocateVirtualMemory (absent from the [jumbo#] census; likely a section
 * view or similar) landed at [0x7effff0000, 0x7fffff0000) and broke the 496G
 * slot. Result: ONE pool instead of two, chrome_elf died earlier. Fix: ceiling
 * at 464G-64KB so the guard pool's under-boundary bite lands on free space, and
 * a 16GB size gate so the 4GB tenant is clamped below too. Leaves
 * [0x73ffff0000, 0x8000000000) = 3 slots + guard margin exclusively for the
 * three PartitionAlloc pools.
 *
 * ml107-ml109 DISABLED (= 0): with the ceiling active, EVERY x64 EC child dies
 * at boot — Steam's children AND Thumper's (ml109: the baseline regressed from
 * 2s-to-splash to ~1min then app death). Mechanism fully identified: some FEX
 * boot-path error fires under the new layout → FEX LogMan::Msg::MFmtImpl
 * formats the message → FEXCore::Allocator::aligned_alloc returns NULL on that
 * thread (rpmalloc not thread-initialized) → unchecked memmove(NULL, msg, len)
 * → c0000005 in ntdll memcpy rva 0x5a4d4 (disassembly-confirmed at FEX rva
 * 0x10bd48). The crash is the LOGGER; the actual FEX complaint is unknown and
 * unknowable until the logger survives allocation failure. PREREQUISITE to
 * re-enabling: patch FEX's MFmtImpl to drop the message on alloc failure (or
 * fix rpmalloc thread-init on wine loader threads), THEN re-enable to read
 * what FEX is actually objecting to. The packing geometry itself (ceiling
 * 464G-64K + direction-aware walk) remains correct on paper.
 *
 * ml110 RE-ENABLED: the prerequisite landed — FEXCore AllocatorHooks now
 * lazily rpmalloc_thread_initialize at every hook (EnsureThreadHeap), so the
 * logger survives on uninitialized threads. Thumper verified clean on the new
 * FEX (ml110: ~10k frames, 0 faults) with the ceiling still off. This build
 * turns the ceiling back on: either the FEX objection was a non-fatal warning
 * and the three pools finally land, or the message prints and names it.
 *
 * ml120 THE ARITHMETIC CAME IN, AND 3 POOLS DO NOT FIT. Measured at the moment
 * PartitionAlloc asked:
 *   FREE 0x747fff0000..0x7800000000 = 14336 MB   (slot#0 poisoned from its base)
 *   FREE 0x7c00000000..0x8000000000 = 16384 MB   (slot#2 pristine)
 * and the 15.1GB furniture window was CONSUMED ENTIRELY -- absent from the free
 * list. The occupied run begins at exactly 0x73ffff0000, this ceiling: once the
 * window filled, the advisory relax valve handed out the next-lowest free
 * addresses, which march straight up into slot#0 (64 regions x ~32MB = 2GB).
 * So the valve that stops us dying is also what poisons the slots, and the
 * furniture demand for Steam is >15GB (~17GB and climbing) rather than the
 * ~6GB the ml105 census suggested. 48GB of pools + 17GB of furniture = 65GB in
 * a 63GB window: THREE POOLS ARE ARITHMETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE unless furniture
 * demand is cut, and whether it can be cut is unknown until we know what is in
 * those 15GB (see ios_window_inventory).
 *
 * Pool #2 additionally failed for a 64KB reason: PA's guard-style pool asks for
 * 0x400010000 = 16GB + 64KB, and slot#2 is EXACTLY 16GB with the top of the
 * address space above it, so the guard cannot overhang. A guard pool can only
 * sit at a slot that has 64KB free BELOW it.
 *
 * ml121 THEREFORE TARGETS TWO POOLS, DETERMINISTICALLY, instead of three
 * accidentally. Raising the ceiling to 0x77ffff0000 gives furniture
 * [0x7038000000, 0x77ffff0000) = 31GB (the 15GB it demonstrably needs plus 16GB
 * of headroom, so the relax valve should never fire and never poison anything),
 * and reserves [0x77ffff0000, 0x8000000000) = 32GB + 64KB, which fits exactly:
 *   guard pool -> 0x7800000000 with its 64KB overhang at 0x77ffff0000
 *   plain pool -> 0x7c00000000, exactly 16GB to the top of VA
 * That is the maximum this address space can hold, and it is 2x what ml120
 * achieved. Whether CEF runs on two pools is the next question; three needs a
 * furniture reduction that ios_window_inventory has to justify first.
 *
 * ml124 THIRD POOL BACK ON THE TABLE. The [window] run/tag probe named the
 * tenants at last: ~30 reservations of ~511MB (one per guest thread, 31 live)
 * = 15.4GB, plus ONE 4.06GB read-only run = the ARM64EC code bitmap, which was
 * sized for Windows' 128TB address space instead of iOS's 512GB. Sizing that
 * bitmap from host_addr_space_limit (see alloc_arm64ec_map) drops it 4.06GB ->
 * 16MB, taking furniture from 17.8GB to ~13.7GB -- under the 15.1GB that fits
 * below 0x7400000000. So the ceiling comes back down to 0x73ffff0000 and slot#0
 * is free again, giving the guard pool [0x73ffff0000, 0x7800000000) (its 64KB
 * overhang landing exactly on the ceiling, which is exclusive for furniture)
 * and the two plain pools 0x7800000000 and 0x7c00000000. Three pools.
 *
 * MARGIN IS THIN AND DOES NOT SCALE: 15.1 - 13.7 = ~1.4GB, and every further
 * guest thread costs ~512MB, so roughly three more threads exhausts it. Watch
 * [slot#0] -- if it goes DIRTY the relax valve has spilled into the pool slot
 * again and the per-thread FEX LookupCache reservation is the next thing that
 * has to shrink. */
/* ml125 REVERTED TO 0x77ffff0000. The 3-pool geometry was tried and FAILED:
 * with the window at 15.1GB, furniture (which the ml124 snapshot underestimated
 * — it keeps growing after the jumbo-failure moment it was measured at) filled
 * it to 99.5% (15403 of 15488 MB), the relax valve spilled into slot#0 AND
 * slot#1, the extra pressure revived the #34 pool exec-fault, and it stormed
 * 7.26 MILLION times. CEF never reached PartitionAlloc at all — strictly worse
 * than the 2-pool runs. The EC-bitmap reclaim is KEPT (it is a real 4GB and
 * gives this 31GB window more headroom than ml123 had), but a third pool needs
 * the ~512MB-per-thread FEXCore LookupCache reservation to shrink first; VA

         *
         * These 512MB ranges are FEX's jemalloc HEAP ARENAS, which are process-wide. Tagging one
         * with the thread that happened to trigger it and releasing it when that thread exits is
         * wrong: FEX allocates FEXMem_ThreadState / FEXMem_Lookup / FEXMem_CallRetStacks INSIDE
         * them, and those outlive the triggering thread. ml312 caught the consequence directly --
         * nine arenas came back from this function with freed=1 and were immediately reissued, and
         * the reissued VAs are exactly where the duplicate ThreadStates appear:
         *   0x7d00001000 owned by tids A8, AC and E4   (arena 0x7d00000000, reissued)
         *   0x7d40001000 owned by tids B0 and F0       (arena 0x7d40000000, reissued)
         * Two threads sharing a ThreadState share x28, so one thread's State.rip IS the other's;
         * sharing a CallRetStack means one pops the other's {guest_ret, host_label} pair and
         * branches into a foreign block. That is the #51/#52 signature and the variance source.
         *
         * Refuse to reclaim any arena something has allocated inside. Thread-exit is simply not
         * evidence that a process-wide arena is dead. Arenas never touched are still reclaimable,
         * so the pressure-relief this function exists for survives for the case it is valid in. */
        /* ml313 RETRACTION: the ml312 "KEEPING in-use arenas" guard here was built on a premise
         * ml313 then refuted. Two [vname] records at one address do NOT prove two live owners --
         * [vname] logs allocations but not frees, and the liveness test on ml313's two duplicate
         * ThreadStates showed the first owner went quiet ~20 lines after claiming, long before the
         * second claim: ordinary allocator reuse after thread exit, not a collision. The
         * ThreadState allocations also never appear in the [va-exit] syscall census (they are

         *
         * Blocking reclaim outright would risk VA exhaustion (#43) for no demonstrated benefit.
         * Keep the inuse flag as a DETECTOR instead: if reclaim ever releases an arena that has

         * released ranges showed 28 live FEX structures sitting INSIDE arenas being
         * released — including FEXMem_ThreadState, FEX's per-thread CPU state. Releasing
         * the arena frees that VA; the next reservation is handed the same range, and two
         * owners write the same memory. That is exactly the corruption we kept crashing

         * run), so page reclamation was never the source — VA double-ownership was.
         *
         * The arena belongs to a dead thread, but the allocations inside it OUTLIVE that
         * thread, so "owning thread exited" is not a licence to free the range. Skip it.

 * a zero-filled page. Whether zero-fill is safe hinges on one bit that only Wine knows:
 * VPROT_COMMITTED. Committed-then-vanished means data loss or use-after-free (zeros MASK a
 * real bug); never-committed means lazy-reservation first touch (zeros are the contract).
 *
 * Deliberately no locking: this is called from the Mach exception thread while the faulting
 * thread is suspended possibly holding virtual_mutex, so taking any lock could deadlock.
 * get_page_vprot is a plain two-level array read and the fault paths already use it this
 * way; a stale read only mislabels one diagnostic line. */

        /* iOS-Madeira ml640: AN OWNED ANON-JIT RANGE IS SETTLED — DECIDE IT FIRST.
         *
         * ROOT CAUSE, proven by the ml639 three-view hash:
         *   guest  = 0x706F9B0000  HASH16K aa4f0ea29a4c7f5c
         *   poolRX = 0x1268C8000   HASH16K 7a9fbb551062ff6b
         *   poolRW = 0x7009EEC000  HASH16K 7a9fbb551062ff6b   (slot=71, dup_end=1)
         *   => poolRX == poolRW, the GUEST vm_remap DETACHED.
         * The pool's dual-map is perfect and every emulated write lands in it; the guest
         * VA simply stops sharing those pages, so Mono writes valid code while FEX
         * executes stale bytes and then zeros, running to alias_end and dying with a
         * deterministic c0000005 (identical across four runs: write_gen=792,
         * highest=0x33fd, RIP_off=0x10000).
         *
         * WHY: this function re-enters on every 4KB W<->X transition and, before ever
         * asking whether a JIT already owns the range, it (a) calls plain mprotect()
         * just below and (b) falls into nearest-image classification. A managed
         * assembly Mono mapped as DATA sits immediately below Mono's buffer; its PE
         * header declares SizeOfImage 0x24000 while only 0x1f000 is mapped, so the
         * backward MZ scan claims [image, image+0x24000) — overlapping the first 16KB
         * of the alias. That 16KB is exactly the chunk holding all 792 writes and the
         * divergence. The anon-alias reuse check sits ~250 lines further down, far too
         * late to prevent any of it.
         *
         * So decide ownership FIRST. If a live alias fully covers the request this is an
         * ordinary JIT W<->X transition: the guest VA is already R+X via the pool
         * dual-map, Wine has already recorded the requested LOGICAL protection in
         * set_vprot(), and writes are meant to fault into the alias store emulator.
         * Nothing further is needed — and critically, nothing may re-map or re-classify
         * this range.
         *
         * ⛔ Only ordinary R/W/X transitions take this path. PROT_NONE, decommit,
         * release and teardown must keep their normal behaviour, so they are excluded.
         * ⛔ Do NOT "shrink" any image copy to dodge the overlap: the image path does not
         * remap the guest VA at all (it copies into the pool and registers a logical
         * translation), and truncating a genuine image would break relocations. The real
         * defect is that this object was classified as a native image at all — the
         * durable fix is Wine mapping identity / actual view bounds instead of trusting a
         * nearby MZ header's SizeOfImage. */

                 * pool slot on top of `base`. The PE-image path a few hundred lines down
                 * memcpy()s the image into the pool first and invalidates the icache; this
                 * anonymous path never copied anything. So the very FIRST RW->RX transition
                 * of a Mono JIT buffer replaced everything Mono had already emitted with
                 * zeros.
                 *
                 * That explains the whole ULTRAKILL signature: RX and RW MATCH afterwards
                 * (both now view the same erased pool storage), FEX starts translating at
                 * base+0x33e0, sees `00 00` = `add byte [rax], al` all the way, and dies at
                 * +0x4006. ml625 only stopped destructive remapping on SUBSEQUENT

 * S1 pseudo-processes: per-child ntdll copy.
 *
 * Child "processes" are thread groups in the same Mach task. All modules
 * except ntdll duplicate naturally (the child's loader maps them at fresh
 * VAs → mprotect_exec makes fresh pool copies). ntdll is special: it is
 * pre-mapped once by the unix side at a shared VA, and its .data holds
 * per-process loader state (module list, loader lock, hash table). A child
 * sharing the parent's ntdll .data corrupts both module lists — so each
 * child gets its own pool copy of the whole ntdll image, registered as an
 * owner_peb-tagged mapping entry. Translation picks the copy owned by the
 * current thread's process (see ios_jit_translate_addr_for_owner).
 *
 * The copy source is the LIVE unix-side view: file-state .data (PE-side
 * runtime writes go to the pool copies, never here) plus the handful of
 * unix-written runtime slots we WANT to inherit (syscall/unix-call
 * dispatchers, unixlib handle, xlate hooks — all unix .text addresses that
 * the reloc range-check leaves untouched). Slots holding PARENT-POOL
 * aliases (e.g. the Round-7 EC unix-call thunk) are rebased to the child
 * copy by the pool-pointer sweep below.

     * translates and executes the ORIGINAL pool pages, which still hold the old bytes
     * and zeros beyond. FEX then runs off the end of the buffer — the deterministic
     * one-past-the-end c0000005 we keep hitting.

     * So: keep Wine's LOGICAL protection exactly as the guest asked (set_vprot above
     * already recorded it, so NtQueryVirtualMemory still answers correctly), but
     * re-assert the PHYSICAL protection as R+X. Every guest write then keeps faulting
     * into the alias store emulator and routing to the RW view, which is the design.
     * Decommit / release / no-access are untouched — this only refuses to hand out
     * physical write permission on memory a JIT alias owns.

 * (KERN_MEMORY_ERROR) on a page that was RW the whole time. Four 16KB pages
 * materialise; the fifth does not. The single most likely cause of "mapped, RW,

 * POSIX gives SIGBUS for those pages, and Mach reports KERN_MEMORY_ERROR.
 *
 * Note map_size is rounded with the GUEST 4KB page_mask while iOS host pages are
 * 16KB, and nothing here compares offset+host_size against the file's real size.
 * This records the facts so the next fatal fault can say whether the backing
 * actually covered the view, instead of us guessing.

 * Three builds have now argued about this from the memory curve instead of
 * measuring it. ml608 assumed the full 16MB callret clear was WASTING memory;
 * ml609 shrank it to 4MB and got ~388MB WORSE; the source then showed the clear
 * is a reclaim (anon_mmap_fixed drops the physical pages), so the shrink had
 * stranded the remainder. None of that is a measurement of bytes returned.
 *
 * This is. It runs at the reclaim site itself, which is also the only place the
 * Mach APIs are reachable — FEX's ResetCallRetStack() lives in an arm64ec PE
 * built by llvm-mingw, where __APPLE__ is undefined and mincore/mach_vm_region/
 * task_info do not exist.
 *
 * Two independent instruments, because they fail differently:
 *   - mincore() is EXACT for the byte range but only reports residency.
 *   - the Mach region walk reports dirty + swapped-out (i.e. compressed, which
 *     STILL counts toward the 4096MB jetsam limit — the thing mincore cannot
 *     see) but is REGION-granular, so it can over-count when a region extends
 *     past the range. `span` is logged so that over-count is visible rather
 *     than silent: span >> size means the counts include a neighbour.
 * phys_footprint is sampled too, and will contain unrelated noise from other
 * threads — it is a sanity check on the other two, not the primary number.

 *     guests are 64-bit);
 *   - no abort_thread (that would kill the exception SERVER thread) —

 *
 * Reserve FEX's host arena as a PLACEHOLDER, before any PE module loads.
 *
 * FEX used to pick its own band: probe a 16KB address, reserve 256MB, RELEASE
 * it, then declare the surrounding 4-8GB its own and hope later allocations
 * still won it. On the jailbroken research VM that fails two ways, and both
 * were observed. Sometimes no window exists at selection time -- one launch had
 * EVERY 4GB window from 32-63GB refuse even 16KB. Other times a window is found
 * and Wine then fills it: a selected 32-36GB band ended up holding 131 guest
 * images (PhysX, APEX, steam_api64, even libarm64ecfex), **70 of which were
 * already there before FEX chose it**, leaving an 11MB largest gap by the time
 * a 16MB FEX allocation failed. Probing a free hole says nothing about owning
 * the window.
 *
 * So Wine takes the arena first, and the RESERVATION IS THE CAPACITY PROBE --
 * no probe-and-release. Because the placeholder is a real Wine view, guest DLL
 * placement is excluded from it as a CONSEQUENCE rather than by a separate
 * mechanism. FEX later replaces placeholder slices instead of selecting a band.
 *
 * Sizes: hardware's dedicated high band is 16GB; the constrained regime wants
 * 8GB (4GB is demonstrably too tight -- FEX needs ~3.5GB of spans and code for
 * ~74 threads), with 4GB accepted only as an explicitly-logged limited arena.
 *
 * ⚠️ Runs ONCE per Mach task. Pseudo-processes share one address space, so the
 * arena must be reserved and published process-wide -- they must not each pick
 * one. The usual "ntdll-unix globals break pseudo-processes" rule is INVERTED
 * here: sharing is the intent.
 *
 * On failure it publishes nothing and returns quietly, leaving FEX's own
 * selector to behave exactly as before -- a failed reservation must never break
 * a configuration that works today.
