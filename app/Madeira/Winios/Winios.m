/* Winios.m — iOS user_driver implementation for Wine.
 *
 * The Wine win32u-unix side declares weak externs `winios_pCreateWindow`,
 * `winios_pProcessEvents`, etc. in build/win32u-unix/driver_ios.c. This
 * file implements them and gets linked into Madeira.app, completing the
 * driver-funcs slots. Slots we don't implement here (e.g. WintabProc,
 * Vulkan) stay weak-resolved-to-NULL and __wine_set_user_driver falls
 * back to win32u's always-success nulldrv_* stubs.
 *
 * Architecture goal: every UIKit-side state lives here, on the Madeira
 * app side; the driver-facing surface is plain C functions taking Wine
 * types (HWND, HCURSOR, etc.) so the win32u side stays portable.
 *
 * Current status: SCAFFOLD. Functions return success/identity values
 * suitable for "first frames render" — full UIKit window/event bridging
 * lands incrementally. Real games will need pProcessEvents to actually
 * drain UIKit events into Wine's queue.

 * freeze detector (ml519)
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Every run suffers a long whole-app freeze — measured at 96.0s starting
 * t+8.5s in ml515 — that ends with StikDebug detaching (after which no NEW
 * exec mappings are possible). It is NOT a deadlock in our code: #67's
 * in-process "accuser" sampler could not run during it either, which means
 * the whole Mach TASK is suspended from outside. It happens in Thumper as
 * well as Steam, so it is a property of the port, not of any title.
 *
 * Nothing inside the process can observe a suspension WHILE it happens.
 * But it can be measured RETROSPECTIVELY: sleep a short fixed interval and
 * compare against a clock that keeps counting while we are stopped.
 * mach_absolute_time() does exactly that. gettimeofday() is logged beside
 * it so a device sleep (both jump) is distinguishable from a task
 * suspension (both jump, but the app was foreground) and from a clock
 * glitch (only one jumps).
 *
 * The HEARTBEAT is not decoration. The srcwatch probe wasted two runs
 * because "armed but zero firings" was read as a clean result when it
 * actually meant the probe was dead. Here, silence is ambiguous the same
 * way — no GAP lines could mean no freeze, or a detector that never
 * started. The heartbeat removes that ambiguity: if heartbeats are present
 * and GAPs are absent, the run genuinely did not freeze.
 *
 * Context is logged with each gap so freezes can be correlated ACROSS
 * TITLES: thread count and resident size are the two things that differ
 * most between Thumper (few threads) and Steam (100+), which is exactly
 * the comparison that would show whether cost scales with thread count.
